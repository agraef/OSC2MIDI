TouchOSC Maps
=============

The maps in this directory are for the layouts that come preinstalled with
hexler's [TouchOSC][1]. The layout files can also be downloaded from hexler's
website as a [zip archive][2].

The osc2midi maps have all been generated using the to2omm script from the
[osc2midi-util][3] project. (Please note that the Live and Logic layouts
aren't included here because they do not contain any MIDI mappings.)
