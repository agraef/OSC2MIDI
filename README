THIS PROJECT IS NOW IN AN ALPHA PHASE
you may begin testing and using this.

To try it out download a snapshot of these files extract them, and open the resulting directory.
run the command
 gcc -g *.c -llo -ljack -o osc2midi


 then run
 ./osc2midi -h

 to see the useage and various details that I will write out later.
