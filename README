THIS PROJECT IS NOW IN AN ALPHA PHASE
you may begin testing and using this.

OSC2MIDI is a highly configurable OSC to jack MIDI bridge for linux. It was designed especially
for use of the open source Android app called "Control (OSC+MIDI)" but was deliberately written
to be flexible enough to be used with any OSC controller or target.
Currently messages are only converted from OSC to MIDI but implementing the inverse is under way.

To try it out download a snapshot of these files, extract them, and open the resulting directory.

This project uses cmake. The easiest and safest way to install is to do the following commands:
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  sudo make install

If you are missing anything cmake will tell you. Mostly you will just need cmake, liblo and jack.
On ubuntu just run
  sudo apt-get install cmake liblo-dev libjack-dev

Once installed you can simply run with the command
  osc2midi

For additional details on what options are available run
  osc2midi -h


OSC2MIDI allows you to change the mapping between OSC and MIDI messages using an OSC to MIDI map
file (.omm). This package has several mappings already installed to your home directory in the
folder .osc2midi/. The default mapping is made to work with all the default interfaces that 
come with the Control Android app. Other mappings are:
 touchosc - this was made to work with the proprietary Android app of the same name, but I don't own it so it is untested
 generic - this was made to work with generic OSC clients that send MIDI like messages
 control - identical to the default map, made to work with the control app
 gameOfLife - this mapping is a more detailed mapping for the game of life interface that comes default with Control. It is a bit more musical than the default mapping

Mappings are in plain text and are completely human readable. If you wish to make your own
map file or tweak the existing ones there is extensive documentation in 
~/.osc2midi/default.omm

If you want to try a different mapping just run with the -m argument. i.e. 
  osc2midi -m gameOfLife

This will run with the mapping dictated by gameOfLife.omm in the .osc2midi directory. Files
will be relative this directory. You may also pass an absolute path with this argument.

For creating your own mappings it might be useful to use monitor mode (-mon) which only
prints out the OSC messages that are recieved. While testing a new mapping it is often
useful to run with verbose mode on (-v).

If you develop a mapping that others might find useful please post it in our sourceforge
forums so it can be included with the source.

Also included with this source code are some custom interfaces that can be loaded into
the Control app for Andrdoid and iOS.
